# Shadows

- Shadows play an important role in helping users figure out the relationship between parts of the design.
- The more serious the website personality - the less or no shadow - and the opposite.

- **01.** You don't have to use shadows. Only use them if it makes sense for the website personality
- **02.** Use shadows in small doses, don't add shadows to every element
- **03.** Go light on shadows, don't make them to dark

<div></div>

- **04.** Use small shadows for smaller elements that should stand out (to draw attention)
- **05.** Use medium-sized shadows for larger areas that should stand out a bit more
- **06.** Use large shadows for elements that should really float above the interface

- **07.** Experiment with changing shadows on mouse interaction (click or hover)
- **08.** Bonus: Experiment with glows (colored shadows)
